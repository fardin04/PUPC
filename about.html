        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>At the Photography Club of Presidency University, we believe in the power of capturing moments and sharing
            stories through the lens of a camera. Our vision is to create a vibrant community of photography enthusiasts
            who inspire each other, learn together, and grow their skills.</p>

        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>We organize workshops, photo walks, and competitions that encourage members to explore different styles and
            techniques in photography. Our goal is to help everyone from beginners to advanced photographers improve
            their skills and discover their unique perspectives.</p>

        <h3>What We Have Done</h3>
        <p>Over the past year, we have hosted several successful events, including exhibitions showcasing our members'
            works, collaborative projects with other clubs, and community service through photography. Each event has
            fostered creativity and strengthened our bond as a club.</p>

        <h3>What We Will Do</h3>
        <p>Looking ahead, we plan to expand our activities to include guest lectures from professional photographers,
            collaborative projects with local businesses, and more community outreach initiatives. We aim to provide our
            members with a platform to showcase their work and gain exposure in the photography world.</p>
